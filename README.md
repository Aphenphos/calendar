THINGS TO FIX IN ORDER

        Add your Profile Name in the top right of the page or somewhere it is constantly visible
            Rework add event and and calendar pages perhaps into one page and make them more concise and easy to use
                Various styling changes(
                    Nicer Font
                    Make calendar fit entirely on the page (within reason)
                    better darkmode functionality
                    make input boxes more appropriately sized
                )
                        REMOVE the header from the homepage and make the home page a little more welcoming/inviting
                            make ERROR messages actually pop up (ex EMAIL IS TAKEN or EMAIL is invalid)
                                after all is complete make a actual readable readme so people dont think we are dumb
